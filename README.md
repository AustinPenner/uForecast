µForecast
================

µForecast is a prediction tracking tool designed to record and summarize the predictions you make. Taking inspiration from individuals like Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock, one goal of this project is to help people improve their forecasting capabilities. With this app you can:


- Save your predictions in the domains that interest you
- Log specific details like the prediction's description and entry date
- See how your expectations compare against reality
- Calibrate yourself after reviewing your prediction track record
